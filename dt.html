Model the following food service industry information as a graph
model, and answer the following queries using Cypher.
Consider food service industries like ZOMATO, Swiggy around us.
Popular restaurants are connected to these industries to increase sell. A
person order food through this industry and get offers. A person give
rate(1-5 stars) to company its facility/facilities. and can recommend this
to his/her friends.
4. Identify the labels and relationships, along with their properties, and
draw a high-level Graph model. [3]
5. Create nodes and relationships, along with their properties, and
visualize your actual Graph model. [3]
6. Answer the Queries.
a. Count no. of customers who place order on “1/1/2023” [3]
b. List the names of customers whose name starts with S and
place order using Swiggy [3]
c. List the names of hotels with high rating (>=4).[4]
d. List the most recommended hotels in……. area. [4]



# Step 1: Open MongoDB    using mongosh
mongosh

# Step 2: Create a database for the food service industry graph
use food_service_db

# Step 3: Create collections and insert data for customers, restaurants, and orders
db.customers.insertMany([
  { _id: 1, name: "John Doe", city: "Mumbai" },
  { _id: 2, name: "Sara Lee", city: "Delhi" },
  { _id: 3, name: "Sam Patel", city: "Bangalore" },
  { _id: 4, name: "Sita Sharma", city: "Chennai" }
])

db.restaurants.insertMany([
  { _id: 1, name: "The Royal Dine", rating: 4.5, area: "Mumbai" },
  { _id: 2, name: "Foodie Delight", rating: 3.8, area: "Delhi" },
  { _id: 3, name: "Tasty Treats", rating: 4.2, area: "Bangalore" },
  { _id: 4, name: "Spicy Street", rating: 5, area: "Chennai" }
])

db.orders.insertMany([
  { _id: 1, customerId: 1, restaurantId: 1, date: ISODate("2023-01-01T10:00:00Z"), orderType: "Swiggy", rating: 5, recommendation: true },
  { _id: 2, customerId: 2, restaurantId: 2, date: ISODate("2023-01-02T11:30:00Z"), orderType: "Zomato", rating: 3, recommendation: false },
  { _id: 3, customerId: 3, restaurantId: 3, date: ISODate("2023-01-01T09:15:00Z"), orderType: "Swiggy", rating: 4, recommendation: true },
  { _id: 4, customerId: 4, restaurantId: 4, date: ISODate("2023-01-03T12:00:00Z"), orderType: "Zomato", rating: 5, recommendation: true }
])

# Step 4: Write the queries to fetch the required results

# a. Count number of customers who placed orders on "1/1/2023"
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { date: ISODate("2023-01-01T00:00:00Z") } },
  { $group: { _id: "$customerId" } },
  { $count: "totalCustomers" }
])

# b. List the names of customers whose name starts with "S" and placed orders using "Swiggy"
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { orderType: "Swiggy" } },
  { $lookup: {
    from: "customers",
    localField: "customerId",
    foreignField: "_id",
    as: "customer_info"
  }},
  { $unwind: "$customer_info" },
  { $match: { "customer_info.name": { $regex: "^S" } } },
  { $project: { "customer_info.name": 1 } }
])

# c. List the names of hotels with a high rating (>= 4)
db.restaurants.aggregate([
  { $match: { rating: { $gte: 4 } } },
  { $project: { name: 1, rating: 1 } }
])

# d. List the most recommended hotels in a given area, for example, "Mumbai"
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { recommendation: true } },
  { $lookup: {
    from: "restaurants",
    localField: "restaurantId",
    foreignField: "_id",
    as: "restaurant_info"
  }},
  { $unwind: "$restaurant_info" },
  { $match: { "restaurant_info.area": "Mumbai" } },
  { $group: { _id: "$restaurant_info.name", recommendationCount: { $sum: 1 } } },
  { $sort: { recommendationCount: -1 } }
])

# Step 5: Exit MongoDB   
exit
